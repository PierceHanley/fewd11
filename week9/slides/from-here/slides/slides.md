## Where do we go from here?

The web development ecosystem is large and growing fast, but it starts from the basic technologies you've learned about:

* *HTTP*
* *HTML*
* *CSS*
* *JavaScript*

--

Most things out there are trying to make it easier to do cool things with them, or easier to *avoid* doing boring things with them.

--

### HTTP-based APIs

Make use of data and tools from other sites (e.g. Twitter, DCGOV).

--

### Styling

Sass/Less seem more technical but simplify a lot of the headaches of CSS.

--

### JavaScript - Language

Most of the growth is in this sphere:

* New language features coming to make it more pleasant to write
 * Promises, lightweight functions
* Newer languages that *compile to JavaScript* (so you can avoid some of the "click-the-monkey" baggage)
 * TypeScript/CoffeeScript/Dart, asm.js

--

### JavaScript - Ecosystem

* Lots of dedicated libraries for different needs (e.g. D3.js)
* Can do richer applications with React or Angular
* Can start doing back-end work with Node

--

### Development Process & Tools

* *Source control:* Git
* *Build systems:* Grunt, Gulp
* *Library management:* Bower
* *Code Quality:* JSHint
* *Testing:* Karma, Jasmine

**Use the terminal!**

--

### Community

* Plenty of meetups related to any particular technology
 * Language/tool-specific (e.g. DCJS)
 * Community groups (e.g. Code for America)
